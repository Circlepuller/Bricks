Bricks
======

A lightweight web framework for PHP >= 5.2.

__Status:__ _Stable_ &ndash; try to expect that 1.2 will introduce breaking features.

Like how controllers work? Don't like the file naming system? __Fork__ Bricks! __Give feedback__ via the issue tracker!

Officially supported servers for Bricks are __Apache__ and __Nginx__. For Nginx support, check out [this paste on Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/4umfLzbU) for an example `nginx.conf`.

Oh, and wiki documentation is _coming soon_.
